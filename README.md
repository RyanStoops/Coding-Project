Three Batters Up

Game Overview:
You are an MLB pitcher, facing three different batters. The batters are either eager to swing or cautious. If they’re eager, they will swing at most pitches. If they’re cautious, they are less likely to swing. The type of batter will be identified before you pitch. The goal is to trick the eager batters to swing at tough pitches and not the strikes. This decreases their odds of hitting the ball. Additionally, you don’t want the cautious batters to swing at your strikes. You will earn points per the scoring list below.

How to play:

Before you pitch, the type of batter you face will be identified.

For each pitch, you can throw three different types of pitches, a fastball, curveball, or slider.


                                                                           
Fastball:  High odds of being a strike    High odds of being hit  
                                                                           
Curveball: Medium odds of being a strike  Medium odds of being hit 
                                                                        
Slider:    Low odds of being a strike     Low odds of being hit    

Additionally, you can throw your chosen pitch at a high velocity, or a low velocity. This changes the chances of a pitch being a strike, and it changes the chances of a pitch being hit.

 Fast: Slightly decreases the odds of any pitch being a strike     Lower odds of being hit 

 Slow: Slightly increases the odds of any pitch being a strike     Higher odds of being hit


The speed of a pitch acts as microadjustment, for example, a slow slider is still more difficult to hit than a fast curveball. A fast fastball is still more likely to be a strike than a slow curveball.

After each pitch, the batter count (strikes and balls) will be shown, or you will be told if the batter hit the ball, struck out, or was walked. The game will help you keep track of how many points you gained or lost, and your total score.
